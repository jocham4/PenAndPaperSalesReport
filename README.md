# PenAndPaperSalesReport

This is a mock sales report completed as a part of DataCamp's Professional Data Analyst Certification. To complete it, 14,000 orders and customer data were analyzed to identify which newly implemented sales technique was most effective. 

All analysis was performed in Python, relying heavily on Pandas for analysis, cleaning, and validation
and Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations.
